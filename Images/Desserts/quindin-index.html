            Quindim is a traditional Brazilian dessert made with egg yolks, sugar, and coconut. This rich, glossy, and golden custard 
            is baked to perfection, creating a creamy center and a lightly toasted coconut crust. Quindim is a simple yet indulgent treat that’s perfect for any occasion.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded coconut</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
            <li>Butter and sugar (for greasing the molds)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease individual molds or a round baking dish with butter and coat with sugar. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth. Strain the yolks through a fine sieve to remove any membranes.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar, shredded coconut, melted butter, and coconut milk to the yolks. Mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared molds or baking dish, filling them about 3/4 of the way.</li>
            <li>Place the molds in a large roasting pan. Fill the roasting pan with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the molds, creating a water bath (bain-marie).</li>
            <li>Bake for 30-40 minutes (or longer for a large dish), or until the quindim is set and the top is golden.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
            <li>To serve, run a knife around the edges to loosen the quindim. Invert onto a serving plate, revealing the glossy golden top. Enjoy!</li>
