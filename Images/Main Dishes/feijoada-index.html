            Feijoada is a classic Brazilian dish made with black beans, a variety of meats (such as pork, sausage, and beef), 
            and flavorful seasonings. It's a rich, hearty stew typically served with rice, collard greens, and orange slices.
            Feijoada is often enjoyed during festive occasions, family gatherings, and special celebrations.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups dried black beans, rinsed</li>
            <li>1/2 pound pork shoulder, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1/2 pound sausage (such as chorizo or Brazilian linguiça), sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 pound smoked sausage, sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 pound bacon, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 pound beef short ribs (optional)</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>6 cups water or chicken broth</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional, for extra flavor)</li>
            <li>1 bunch collard greens, chopped (for serving)</li>
            <li>Orange slices (for serving)</li>
            <li>Rice (for serving)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, soak the black beans in water overnight. Drain and rinse the beans before cooking.</li>
            <li>In a separate large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the diced bacon, pork shoulder, sausage slices, smoked sausage, and beef short ribs (if using). Cook until the meats are browned, about 10-12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the soaked black beans, bay leaves, smoked paprika (if using), and water or chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 2 to 3 hours, or until the beans are tender and the flavors are well combined.</li>
            <li>Once the beans are cooked, season the feijoada with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust the consistency by adding more water or broth if needed.</li>
            <li>While the feijoada simmers, sauté the collard greens in a bit of olive oil until tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve the feijoada hot with rice, collard greens, and orange slices on the side. The orange slices help cut through the richness of the dish and add a refreshing contrast.</li>
        </ol>
