        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups cooked black beans (or any type of beans you prefer)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 pound bacon, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 pound sausage (such as chorizo or Portuguese sausage), sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cassava flour (farinha de mandioca)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1/4 cup green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional, for extra flavor)</li>
            <li>1 boiled egg, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil for frying the cassava flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the diced bacon and sausage slices to the skillet. Cook until the bacon is crispy and the sausage is browned, about 7-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a separate pan, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat and fry the cassava flour (farinha de mandioca) until it turns golden brown, stirring occasionally. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Once the bacon and sausage are cooked, add the cooked beans to the skillet and stir well. Cook for another 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the fried cassava flour to the bean mixture and stir to incorporate. Adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper, and smoked paprika (if using).</li>
            <li>Stir in the chopped parsley and green onions, and cook for another 2 minutes to let the flavors meld together.</li>
            <li>Serve hot, garnished with chopped boiled egg (optional). Feijão Tropeiro is often enjoyed with rice and a side of salad or fresh vegetables.</li>
