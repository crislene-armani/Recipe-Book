        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups cornmeal (fine or medium grind)</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Optional: grated coconut or cheese for topping</li>
            <li>Optional: eggs or cooked vegetables for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal and salt. Gradually add the water, mixing until the cornmeal absorbs the liquid.</li>
            <li>Let the mixture sit for about 10 minutes to allow the cornmeal to soften.</li>
            <li>Place a pot with a steamer basket over medium heat, adding water to the bottom (but not touching the steamer). Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cornmeal mixture to the steamer basket and cover. Steam for about 15â€“20 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure even cooking.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove from the heat and stir in butter until melted and smooth.</li>
            <li>Optional: Add grated coconut or cheese into the cooked cuscuz, or serve with eggs or vegetables on top for extra flavor.</li>
            <li>Serve hot, and enjoy your Cuscuz Nordestino as a breakfast or side dish.</li>
