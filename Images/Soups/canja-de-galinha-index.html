            <li>6 cups chicken broth or water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup rice (preferably short-grain)</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken thighs (or breasts) to the pot and brown them on all sides, about 5–7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in the chicken broth or water, bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer for about 20–25 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked and tender.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the pot and shred it using two forks. Return the shredded chicken to the pot.</li>
            <li>Add the rice, diced carrots, and peas (if using). Simmer the soup for another 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the vegetables are cooked through.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, add more chicken broth or water to adjust the consistency of the soup.</li>
            <li>Serve hot, garnished with fresh chopped parsley. Enjoy your Canja de Galinha with a slice of bread or crackers on the side!</li>
