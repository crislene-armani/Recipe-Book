        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>6 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 bunch kale, stemmed and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 pound chorizo sausage, sliced</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Optional: 1 bay leaf for extra flavor</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, cooking until softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the diced potatoes, paprika, and chicken broth to the pot. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the soup is simmering, in a separate pan, fry the chorizo slices until crispy, about 5–7 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Once the potatoes are cooked, use a potato masher or immersion blender to mash or blend the soup until smooth, leaving some chunks for texture.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced kale to the soup and simmer for another 5–7 minutes until the kale is tender.</li>
            <li>Stir in the cooked chorizo and season with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, add a bay leaf for extra flavor during the simmering process, then remove before serving.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with a drizzle of olive oil and enjoy your Caldo Verde with crusty bread on the side!</li>
