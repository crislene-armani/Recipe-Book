            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 lb pork ribs or pork belly, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup crushed corn kernels (canjica or hominy corn)</li>
            <li>6 cups chicken or pork broth</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup green peas (optional)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, cooking until softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the pork ribs or pork belly pieces to the pot and cook until browned on all sides, about 7-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in the chicken or pork broth, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer for 20â€“25 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed corn kernels (canjica), diced carrots, and green peas (if using). Continue simmering for another 30-40 minutes, or until the corn is tender and the soup has thickened.</li>
            <li>Season the soup with salt, pepper, and smoked paprika (if desired). Stir well and adjust the seasoning to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley or cilantro. Canjiquinha is often served with crusty bread or rice on the side for a hearty meal!</li>
